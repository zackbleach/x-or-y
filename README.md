======

Part of simple game based on the Twitter API that asks you to guess which account a tweet comes from.
This service provides an API which will return a random tweet from one of two specified users. 

To allow the app to access the Twitter API, create a file called 'twitter.cfg' in the root
of this project. It should contain your API Key, API Secret, Access Token & Access Token Secret. 
An example file is included in this repo.
